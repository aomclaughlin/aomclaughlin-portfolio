<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Andrew O. McLaughlin has dedicated his career to public service. At 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving for seven years, including a deployment to Iraq. This experience continues to shape his perspective as a public servant, researcher, and educator. Andrew holds a PhD in Media and Communication Studies from the University of Oregon’s School of Journalism and Communication, where he studied how communication and media censorship policies have influenced the political economy of nonfiction combat footage.</p>
<p>Since completing his PhD, Andrew has taught in higher education for 10 years and worked in Chicago as a Veterans Career Coach in a workforce development agency’s Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. He later transitioned into strategic public health communications, starting with the State of Wisconsin’s COVID-19 response and, most recently, serving as a Digital Communication Content Strategist (GS-1001-23) in CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health (OSH).</p>
<p>Andrew is a running enthusiast, prioritizing daily practice over speed and distance. In 2020, he completed the Great Virtual Race Across Tennessee (GVRAT) 1000k in 101 days. Currently living in Madison, WI, he is grateful for his access to the region’s Driftless Area.</p>
